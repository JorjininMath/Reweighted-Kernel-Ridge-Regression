This repo contains the code and results for the RW-KRR with noise variance weight.

# Code Structure

# Numerical results
~~* Finish Simple case~~
    * When compute slope, use MSE instead of RMSE
    * use smaller dimension for Dejong (d = 3), higher dimension for Griewank (d = 10)
~~* Finish Strict case with different combinations of $m$ and $n$, under fixed total budget $B$~~
    * Extend the range of total budgets (make minimum value smaller)
    * Try constant noise variance to compare with benchmark paper
